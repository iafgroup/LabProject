Networking Lab Direcitons
==========================

Networking Lab Directions
Purpose: 
---------
The purpose of this networking lab is to familiarize individuals with Wireshark and also to help students learn how to intercept and read packets. 

Part I: Unauthorized Wi-Fi Access
-----------------------------------


Part II: Unauthorized Administrator Access
--------------------------------------------
We have intercepted a packet flowing from the router using Wireshark:

GET /style_gn.css HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJkdXBlciFAIw==
Accept: text/css,*/*;q=0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, likeGecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.13 Safari/537.36
DNT: 1
Referer: http://192.168.1.1/
Accept-Encoding: sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Host: 192.168.1.1

Answer the following questions:
1.	Given the intercepted packet data, can you determine what this packet was used for?


2.	What type of encryption was used to encrypt the credentials? How can you tell?


3.	Briefly describe what types of methods can be used to intercept a packet like this.



Part III: Reflecting
---------------------
This router was setup using WEP security and a fairly strong password. How come the admin credentials were still able to be gathered and decrypted?




What can be done to increase the overall security of this router? Please give specific answers.
