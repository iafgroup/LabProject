Networking Lab Direcitons
==========================

Networking Lab Directions
Purpose: 
---------
The purpose of this networking lab is to familiarize individuals with Wireshark and also to help students learn how to intercept and read packets. 

Part I: Unauthorized Wi-Fi Access
-----------------------------------


Part II: Unauthorized Administrator Access
--------------------------------------------
Step 1.
Browse to "http://192.168.1.1"
You will be prompted for login credentials.

With wireshark running enter the following credentials:
Username: admin
Password: HackMe

Go back to your wireshark window and locate the packet that sends the authorization information to the router.
You should see something similiar to the following:

GET /style_gn.css HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJkdXBlciFAIw==
Accept: text/css,*/*;q=0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, likeGecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.13 Safari/537.36
DNT: 1
Referer: http://192.168.1.1/
Accept-Encoding: sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Host: 192.168.1.1

Using the packet you captured and the credentials you were provided, can you determine the credentials passed in the example packet from above?

What are the credentials?

What algorithm was used to encode the credentials?


Part III: Reflecting
---------------------
This router was setup using WEP security and a fairly strong password. How come the admin credentials were still able to be gathered and decrypted?




What can be done to increase the overall security of this router? Please give specific answers.
